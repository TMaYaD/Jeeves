# Testing Strategy

<!-- This document describes the current state of the system. Rewrite sections when they become inaccurate. Do not append change logs. -->

This document outlines the testing methodology and standards for the Jeeves project.

## Development Methodology: TDD (Top-Down)

We follow a strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) cycle in a Top-Down approach. The fundamental step before adding any new feature is to define its expected behavior via a failing test.

### Testing Hierarchy

1. **Write E2E Tests First**
   Start with end-to-end (E2E) tests that verify complete user journeys. E2E tests validate that all pieces of the system work together from the user's perspective.
   - *Workflow:* Write test that exercises the full user flow → Test fails → Implement.

2. **Write Integration Tests Second**
   Test component interactions at the boundaries (e.g., API boundaries, database access boundaries).

3. **Write Unit Tests Third**
   Test pure business logic, utilities, and parsers in complete isolation.

### Implementation Workflow

1. Write a failing test defining the expected behavior.
2. Implement minimum code to make the test pass.
3. Refactor and ensure the tests remain green.
4. Check for regressions by running the full test suite.

## Core Testing Principles

- **Test Real Behavior Only**: Avoid mocking system components whenever possible. Test code as it would run in production. If a component is too complex to test without excessive mocking, it should be redesigned.
- **Automation First**: Linter, analyzer, and the full test suite must pass locally before any commits are pushed.
- **No Unverified Work**: Code is considered incomplete until it has corresponding automated tests demonstrating its correctness.

## Stack-Specific Testing

### Frontend (Flutter)

- **Framework**: `flutter_test`.
- **E2E/Integration**: Flutter Integration Tests for on-device testing.
- **Unit/Widget**: Widget tests and standard Dart unit tests for Riverpod providers and logic.

### Backend (FastAPI)

- **Framework**: `pytest` running with `pytest-asyncio` for asynchronous tests.
- **Coverage**: `pytest-cov` to ensure critical business logic is tested.
- **Local DB**: Provide a test database (e.g., using `aiosqlite` or a testing PostgreSQL container) to run real integration tests rather than mocking the database layer.

## Manual testing on the Android emulator (for agents)

For flows that are impractical to cover with `flutter_test` / integration tests — in particular the Sign-In With Solana round-trip, which requires a real MWA-compatible wallet — drive the running emulator via `adb`. This section captures the stable coordinates and navigation paths so successive sessions don't have to re-discover them.

### Device & app context

- Emulator physical size: **1080x2400** (`adb shell wm size` to confirm). All coordinates below assume this; if the device is different, scale proportionally.
- Jeeves package (alpha flavor debug): `loonyb.in.jeeves.alpha`
- Mock MWA Wallet: `com.solana.mwallet`, PIN **1234** (the "Mock" is the wallet — the app itself must NOT be mocked).
- Compose stack: `podman compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml up -d` (backend reachable from emulator at `http://10.0.2.2:8000`).
- SWS build command:
  ```
  flutter build apk --flavor alpha --debug \
    --dart-define=JEEVES_AUTH_MODE=sws \
    --dart-define=JEEVES_API_BASE_URL=http://10.0.2.2:8000
  ```

### How to drive `adb` efficiently

- **Chain taps, don't screenshot between every step.** Each `screencap` + `pull` is ~1–2s of overhead; chain the full navigation in one Bash call, then screenshot only at the verification point. Example — sign-out from inbox:
  ```
  adb shell input tap 106 170    # open drawer
  sleep 1.5
  adb shell input tap 250 2280   # Settings
  sleep 1.2
  adb shell input tap 540 552    # Sign out tile
  sleep 1
  adb shell input tap 844 1378   # confirm
  sleep 2
  adb shell screencap -p /sdcard/s.png && adb pull /sdcard/s.png /tmp/s.png
  ```
- Use `adb shell monkey -p loonyb.in.jeeves.alpha -c android.intent.category.LAUNCHER 1` to cold-launch; prefix with `adb shell am force-stop loonyb.in.jeeves.alpha` for a clean start.
- Stream Flutter errors: `adb logcat > /tmp/jeeves.log &` then grep for `flutter:` and `AndroidRuntime`. MWA failures surface as `com.solana.mobilewalletadapter.clientlib.*` stacks.

### Navigation tree with tap coordinates

Coordinates are `(x, y)` in device pixels. The drawer lives under a hamburger icon on every main shell route.

| Location | Coords | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **App shell (Inbox etc.)** → hamburger / drawer | `(106, 170)` | Top-left icon, ~7% of a 1080-wide screen. |
| **Drawer** → Settings row | `(250, 2280)` | Near bottom of drawer; wait ~1s after opening. |
| **Settings** → back arrow | `(106, 170)` | Top-left `BackButton`. |
| **Settings (signed-in)** → Sign out tile | `(540, 552)` | Second tile under SYNC. |
| **Settings (signed-out)** → "Sign in to sync across devices" tile | `(540, 440)` | First tile under SYNC. |
| **Sign-out confirm dialog** → red "Sign out" | `(844, 1378)` | Right-side action. |
| **Sign-out confirm dialog** → "Cancel" | `(284, 1378)` | Left-side action. |
| **Login screen** → "Connect wallet" button | `(540, 1416)` | Center. In SWS mode this is the only action. |
| **Login screen (canPop=true)** → close (X) | `(88, 140)` | Only present when reached via push (e.g. from Settings). |
| **Notification permission dialog** → "Don't allow" | `(540, 1452)` | First-launch prompt. |
| **Mock MWA Wallet — connect prompt** → "Connect" | `(810, 2200)` | Green button, bottom-right. |
| **Mock MWA Wallet — SIWS sign message** → "Approve" | `(800, 2160)` | Green button, bottom-right. |

### Reference flows

**First-launch SWS sign-in** (assumes Mock MWA Wallet already installed):
1. Dismiss notification permission: `tap 540 1452`
2. Connect wallet: `tap 540 1416`, wait ~2s for wallet UI
3. Wallet "Connect": `tap 810 2200`, wait ~2–3s for SIWS dialog
4. Wallet "Approve": `tap 800 2160`, wait ~3s
5. Verify: `/inbox` visible with "What's on your mind?"; `POST /auth/sws/challenge` and `POST /auth/sws` both 200 in backend logs; row in `users` with `solana_public_key` populated.

**Sign-out from Settings** (should stay on Settings in its signed-out state):
1. From `/inbox`: `tap 106 170` → `tap 250 2280` → `/settings`
2. `tap 540 552` (Sign out tile) → dialog
3. `tap 844 1378` (red confirm)
4. Verify: still on `/settings`, SYNC section now shows "Sign in to sync across devices" tile (not "Sync enabled" + "Sign out").
