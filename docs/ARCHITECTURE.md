# Architecture

<!-- This document describes the current state of the system. Rewrite sections when they become inaccurate. Do not append change logs. -->

This document describes the architectural design of Jeeves, a productivity-focused todos application.

## High-Level System Overview

The system follows an offline-first architecture, allowing clients to work securely and seamlessly without an internet connection, while continuously syncing with the central database when online.

- **Frontend Clients:** Flutter-based applications supporting mobile (iOS/Android), web, and desktop.
- **Backend Service:** A Python-based FastAPI service responsible for business logic, integrations, and AI endpoints.
- **Sync Engine:** PowerSync for real-time, bidirectional replication between local embedded databases and the central PostgreSQL database.
- **Primary Database:** PostgreSQL.

## Architectural Principles

- **Flat, Explicit Code**: We prefer flat folder structures and explicit code flows over deep abstractions.
- **Group by Feature**: Code is organized by feature modules (e.g., Auth, Todos, Settings) rather than technical layers (Controllers, Models, Views).
- **Minimal Coupling**: Dependencies between features should be minimized to allow them to be developed, tested, and maintained independently.
- **RESTful APIs**: We prefer RESTful resources over generic actions (Ex: `POST /session` over `/login`, `POST /user` over `/register`).

## Tech Stack Details

### Frontend (Flutter)

Located in `app/`.

- **State Management:** `flutter_riverpod` and `riverpod_annotation`.
- **Local Storage:** Offline-first architecture using `drift` and `sqlite3_flutter_libs` as the structured SQL engine.
- **API Communication:** `dio` and `retrofit`.
- **Data Models:** `freezed` and `json_serializable` for robust immutable models.
- **Sync:** PowerSync (`powersync` Dart package) — bidirectional sync via `JevesBackendConnector` and a self-hosted `journeyapps/powersync-service` instance.

### Backend (Python/FastAPI)

Located in `backend/`.

- **Framework:** `fastapi` with Python 3.12+ running on `uvicorn`.
- **Database ORM:** `sqlalchemy` (with `asyncpg` for async I/O) and `alembic` for migrations.
- **Validation:** `pydantic`.
- **Background Tasks:** `celery` with `redis`.
- **AI Integrations:** `anthropic` client library.
- **Architecture:** Follows the [12-Factor App methodology](./BACKEND_GUIDELINES.md) (stateless processes, environment-based configuration, etc.).

### Sync Engine

PowerSync provides bidirectional offline-first sync between the Flutter SQLite store and PostgreSQL:

- The Flutter app connects to a self-hosted `journeyapps/powersync-service` instance.
- Three sync shapes are replicated per user: `todos`, `tags`, `todo_tags` (all filtered by `user_id`).
- The backend issues short-lived JWTs from `GET /powersync/credentials`; PowerSync validates them using the shared `JEEVES_SECRET_KEY`.
- Local writes made through the PowerSync client are queued and uploaded to the backend REST API via `JevesBackendConnector.uploadData()`.
- PowerSync uses Postgres for internal bucket storage — no additional database is required.
- Conflict resolution: last-write-wins (acceptable for v1).

## Local Search

Universal search is implemented entirely client-side against the local SQLite store, with no network dependency.

### SearchDao

`lib/database/daos/search_dao.dart` — a plain Dart class (not a `@DriftAccessor`) that exposes a single `search(userId, SearchQuery)` method returning a reactive `Stream<List<SearchResult>>`.

**Query strategy:** A single Drift LEFT OUTER JOIN across `todos`, `todo_tags`, and `tags`. Drift's type-safe `readTable` / `readTableOrNull` API handles all column mapping so no manual SQL parsing is needed. Structured filters (state, energy level, time estimate, due date range) are applied as SQL WHERE clauses. Free-text search and tag-scope filtering are applied in Dart after the join, which avoids FTS5 trigger compatibility issues with PowerSync views.

**Why not FTS5?** In production, `todos` is a PowerSync-managed SQLite view. SQLite only supports `INSTEAD OF` triggers on views, not `AFTER INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE`, so the standard FTS5 content-table + trigger pattern cannot be used. LIKE + Dart-side string matching on 10k rows completes in < 10 ms in practice.

### Search models

- `lib/models/search_query.dart` — plain Dart class holding text, state set, tag-ID set, energy levels, date range, and time-estimate cap. No code generation required.
- `lib/models/search_result.dart` — wraps a Drift `Todo` + its `List<Tag>` + a `Set<SearchMatchField>` indicating which fields matched + an optional notes snippet.

### Providers

`lib/providers/search_provider.dart`:

- `searchQueryProvider` — `NotifierProvider<SearchQueryNotifier, SearchQuery>` that the search screen writes to on each (debounced) keystroke.
- `searchResultsProvider` — `StreamProvider.autoDispose` that watches `searchQueryProvider` and delegates to `SearchDao.search`, grouping results by `GtdState`.
- `recentSearchesProvider` — `NotifierProvider<RecentSearchesNotifier, List<String>>` backed by `SharedPreferences` (max 10 entries, MRU order).

### Navigation

The search screen lives at `/search` outside the `ShellRoute` (full-screen, no drawer). It is reachable via:
- The **Search** entry in the drawer navigation (visible on every GTD list screen).
- **Ctrl+K** or **/** keyboard shortcuts registered in `AppShell` via Flutter's `Shortcuts` + `Actions` API.

## Daily Planning State

The daily planning feature uses a mix of global `ValueNotifier` objects (for cross-widget reactivity without a Riverpod container) and `SharedPreferences` for persistence across restarts.

### Key objects

| Object | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `planningCompletionNotifier` | `ValueNotifier<bool>` | `true` when the ritual has been completed today |
| `bannerDismissedNotifier` | `ValueNotifier<bool>` | `true` when the banner has been dismissed today |
| `DailyPlanningNotifier` | Riverpod `NotifierProvider` | Step navigation, task mutations, banner dismiss, skip/snooze |
| `PlanningSettingsNotifier` | Riverpod `NotifierProvider` | User preferences: planning time, notification/banner toggles, snooze duration |

Both `ValueNotifier` objects are initialised from `SharedPreferences` in `initPlanningCompletion()`, which is called in `main()` before `runApp`.

### Planning nudges

The ritual can no longer be auto-launched. Users are nudged through two opt-in mechanisms:

1. **`PlanningBanner`** (`lib/widgets/planning_banner.dart`) — rendered at the top of `AppShell` (all shell-hosted routes). Visible when `planningCompletionNotifier == false && !bannerDismissedNotifier && planningSettings.bannerEnabled`. Tapping navigates to `/planning`; the × button calls `DailyPlanningNotifier.dismissBannerForToday()`.

2. **Local notification** — scheduled daily at the user's configured planning time via `NotificationService.schedulePlanningReminder()`. Uses `flutter_local_notifications` `zonedSchedule` with `matchDateTimeComponents: time` so the OS re-fires it every day without app interaction. Notification actions: Open (→ `/planning`), Snooze (one-off reschedule), Skip today (cancel until tomorrow). Handled in `_handleNotificationResponse` in `main.dart`. `matchDateTimeComponents: time` means the OS reschedules the notification daily automatically — snooze cancels the repeating schedule and registers a one-off fire instead.

### SharedPreferences keys

| Key | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `planning_ritual_completed_date` | `yyyy-MM-dd` | Date of last completed ritual |
| `planning_banner_dismissed_date` | `yyyy-MM-dd` | Date banner was last dismissed |
| `planning_notification_skipped_date` | `yyyy-MM-dd` | Date user hit "Skip today" |
| `planning_notification_snoozed_until` | ISO-8601 datetime | When the snoozed notification will fire |
| `planning_settings_time_hour` | `int` | Planning time hour |
| `planning_settings_time_minute` | `int` | Planning time minute |
| `planning_settings_notification_enabled` | `bool` | Notification toggle |
| `planning_settings_banner_enabled` | `bool` | Banner toggle |
| `planning_settings_default_snooze_duration` | `int` (minutes) | Default snooze duration |

## Navigation & Global Filter State

### Tag Cloud Navigation Filter

A sticky, multi-select context-tag filter lives in the navigation drawer and persists across screen navigation for the duration of the app session.

**State:** `TagFilterNotifier` (a `Notifier<Set<String>>` in `app/lib/providers/tag_filter_provider.dart`) holds the active set of context tag IDs.  Calling `toggle(id)` adds or removes a tag; `clear()` resets the set.  The `tagFilterProvider` is app-scoped so the state survives route changes.

**Drawer widget:** `TagCloud` (`app/lib/screens/common/tag_cloud.dart`) renders a `Wrap` of `FilterChip`s sourced from `contextTagsWithCountProvider`.  Chip visual weight (font size and opacity) scales linearly with each tag's active-task count relative to the maximum in the set.  Tags with zero active tasks are hidden unless currently selected.  Long-pressing a chip opens `TagManagementSheet` for rename/recolour/merge.

**Active filter indicator:** `_ActiveFilterBar` (embedded in `GtdListScreen`) and `_InboxFilterBar` (embedded in `InboxScreen`) show the currently selected tags as removable `InputChip`s plus a "Clear all" button.  The CONTEXTS section header in the drawer gains a count badge when any filter is active.

**DAO layer:** `TagDao.watchTagsWithActiveCount(userId, type)` uses a `customSelect` SQL query with `readsFrom: {tags, todoTags, todos}` so the count stream re-emits reactively when any of the three tables change.  Each GTD watch method in `TodoDao` and `InboxDao` accepts an optional `Set<String> tagIds` parameter; when non-empty a SQL subquery enforces AND semantics: `COUNT(DISTINCT tag_id) WHERE tag_id IN (...) = N`.

**Provider wiring:** Every GTD list provider (`nextActionsProvider`, `waitingForProvider`, `somedayMaybeProvider`, `blockedTasksProvider`, `scheduledProvider`, `inboxItemsProvider`) watches `tagFilterProvider` and passes the current tag set to its DAO method.  When the filter changes, Riverpod automatically cancels and re-subscribes the DAO stream, so the list view re-renders without any additional work in the UI layer.
