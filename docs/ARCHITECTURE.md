# Architecture

<!-- This document describes the current state of the system. Rewrite sections when they become inaccurate. Do not append change logs. -->

This document describes the architectural design of Jeeves, a productivity-focused todos application.

## High-Level System Overview

The system follows an offline-first architecture, allowing clients to work securely and seamlessly without an internet connection, while continuously syncing with the central database when online.

- **Frontend Clients:** Flutter-based applications supporting mobile (iOS/Android), web, and desktop.
- **Backend Service:** A Python-based FastAPI service responsible for business logic, integrations, and AI endpoints.
- **Sync Engine:** PowerSync for real-time, bidirectional replication between local embedded databases and the central PostgreSQL database.
- **Primary Database:** PostgreSQL.

## Architectural Principles

- **Flat, Explicit Code**: We prefer flat folder structures and explicit code flows over deep abstractions.
- **Group by Feature**: Code is organized by feature modules (e.g., Auth, Todos, Settings) rather than technical layers (Controllers, Models, Views).
- **Minimal Coupling**: Dependencies between features should be minimized to allow them to be developed, tested, and maintained independently.
- **RESTful APIs**: We prefer RESTful resources over generic actions (Ex: `POST /session` over `/login`, `POST /user` over `/register`).

## Tech Stack Details

### Frontend (Flutter)

Located in `app/`.

- **State Management:** `flutter_riverpod` and `riverpod_annotation`.
- **Local Storage:** Offline-first architecture using `drift` and `sqlite3_flutter_libs` as the structured SQL engine.
- **API Communication:** `dio` and `retrofit`.
- **Data Models:** `freezed` and `json_serializable` for robust immutable models.
- **Sync:** PowerSync (`powersync ^2.x` Dart package) — bidirectional sync via `JeevesBackendConnector` and a self-hosted `journeyapps/powersync-service` instance.
- **Web storage:** OPFS-backed SQLite via `WebPowerSyncOpenFactory` from `package:powersync/web.dart`, using the WASM worker assets in `app/web/`.

### Backend (Python/FastAPI)

Located in `backend/`.

- **Framework:** `fastapi` with Python 3.12+ running on `uvicorn`.
- **Database ORM:** `sqlalchemy` (with `asyncpg` for async I/O) and `alembic` for migrations.
- **Validation:** `pydantic`.
- **Background Tasks:** `celery` with `redis`.
- **AI Integrations:** `anthropic` client library.
- **Architecture:** Follows the [12-Factor App methodology](./BACKEND_GUIDELINES.md) (stateless processes, environment-based configuration, etc.).

### Sync Engine

PowerSync provides bidirectional offline-first sync between the Flutter SQLite store and PostgreSQL:

- The Flutter app connects to a self-hosted `journeyapps/powersync-service` instance.
- Three sync shapes are replicated per user: `todos`, `tags`, `todo_tags` (all filtered by `user_id`).
- The backend issues short-lived JWTs from `GET /powersync/credentials`; PowerSync validates them using the shared `JEEVES_SECRET_KEY`.
- Local writes made through the PowerSync client are queued and uploaded to the backend REST API via `JevesBackendConnector.uploadData()`.
- PowerSync uses Postgres for internal bucket storage — no additional database is required.
- Conflict resolution: last-write-wins (acceptable for v1).

## Platform I/O Adapters

Any code that opens a file, spawns a process, or calls a native OS API must be isolated behind a platform adapter using Dart's conditional import mechanism. This keeps `dart:io` out of shared provider and service code so the app compiles cleanly on web without `if (kIsWeb)` branches scattered through business logic.

### The pattern

Three files per adapter:

| File | Compiled on | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `*_stub.dart` | Neither (analyser only) | Throws `UnsupportedError` — gives the analyser a type to resolve on all targets |
| `*_io.dart` | Native (dart:io) | Concrete native implementation; may import `dart:io`, `path_provider`, etc. |
| `*_web.dart` | Web (dart:html) | Concrete web implementation; may import `package:powersync/web.dart`, `dart:js_interop`, etc. |

The entry-point file uses a conditional export to pick the right implementation:

```dart
export '*_stub.dart'
    if (dart.library.io)   '*_io.dart'
    if (dart.library.html) '*_web.dart';
```

**Rule:** any new platform-specific I/O must follow this pattern. Never add `if (kIsWeb)` branches inside provider or service code — put platform divergence in the adapter file.

### Current adapters

#### `app/lib/database/powersync_storage.dart`

Opens the process-wide `PowerSyncDatabase`.

- **Native (`powersync_storage_io.dart`):** resolves a file path via `path_provider`, runs the one-shot legacy-table migration, and opens `PowerSyncDatabase(schema, path)` using the native SQLite library (`sqlite3_flutter_libs`).  This path is shared by Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, and Windows — a platform gaining divergent behaviour (e.g. encryption key from Keychain) should split its own adapter rather than branching inside `powersync_storage_io.dart`.
- **Web (`powersync_storage_web.dart`):** opens `PowerSyncDatabase.withFactory(WebPowerSyncOpenFactory(path: 'jeeves'), schema)` backed by OPFS in Chrome and IndexedDB in other browsers.

#### `app/lib/services/platform_helper.dart`

Detects whether the app is running inside an Android emulator (for API host rewriting).

- **Native (`platform_helper_io.dart`):** reads `Platform.isAndroid` from `dart:io`.
- **Web (`platform_helper.dart` stub):** always returns `false`.

### Web worker assets

`WebPowerSyncOpenFactory` requires two files to be present in `app/web/` at runtime:

| Asset | Source |
|---|---|
| `sqlite3.wasm` | PowerSync GitHub release for the pinned `powersync` version |
| `powersync_db.worker.js` | Same release |

These files are **not committed** (`app/.gitignore`).  Run `make setup` (or `tool/fetch_web_assets.sh` directly) to download them.  The script reads the exact version from `app/pubspec.lock` so the assets always match the Dart package.

### COOP / COEP headers (OPFS requirement)

OPFS and `SharedArrayBuffer` require [cross-origin isolation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer#security_requirements).  The server must send:

```text
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
```

- **Development:** `flutter run -d web-server --web-header "Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin" --web-header "Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp"`
- **Production:** configure in the reverse proxy or CDN in front of the Flutter web build.

## Focus Mode Execution

Focus Mode is the task execution layer activated after daily planning. Its architecture separates ephemeral timer state from durable task state.

### Routing

`/focus/active` is a top-level `GoRoute` registered **outside** the `ShellRoute`, so `AppShell` (drawer, navigation) is not rendered. The user sees only the active task. `/focus` (the daily plan list) remains inside the `ShellRoute`.

The router has a `redirect` callback that checks `focusSessionPlanningCompletionNotifier.value`; `/focus` and `/focus/*` redirect to `/focus-session-planning` when daily planning has not been completed. `focusSessionPlanningCompletionNotifier` is also set as `refreshListenable` so the guard re-evaluates reactively when planning state changes.

### FocusModeNotifier (`providers/focus_session_provider.dart`)

A `NotifierProvider<FocusModeNotifier, FocusModeState>` that holds ephemeral focus session state:

- `activeTodoId` — the task currently being focused on.
- `sessionStart` — wall-clock start of the active (unpaused) segment.
- `accumulated` — total paused duration to subtract from elapsed.
- `isPaused` / `pauseStart` — pause tracking.

`elapsed` is derived: `now − sessionStart − accumulated`, frozen while paused.

State is **ephemeral** (lost on app restart). If a task is found in `inProgress` state on app launch, the focus screen reconstructs the timer from `todo.inProgressSince` (persisted in the DB).

Key methods:
- `startFocus(todoId)` — transitions task to `inProgress` via `TodoDao.transitionState`, sets `sessionStart`.
- `resumeFrom(todoId, inProgressSince)` — restores session after restart; does not touch DB state.
- `pauseFocus()` / `resumeFocus()` — UI-only timer pause; task stays `inProgress` in the DB.
- `endFocus()` — clears all state; caller must perform the DB transition first.

### ActiveFocusScreen (`screens/active_focus_screen.dart`)

A `ConsumerStatefulWidget` with `WidgetsBindingObserver` for lifecycle events:

- **Complete**: `transitionState(done)` → `endFocus()` → snackbar with next task → `context.go('/focus')`.
- **Abandon**: `transitionState(deferred)` → `endFocus()` → `context.go('/focus')`. Task lands in `deferred` state (separate from Next Actions; user replans or skips tomorrow).
- **Pause/Resume**: toggled on `FocusModeNotifier` only; no DB write.
- **Exit (×)**: confirmation dialog → `pauseFocus()` → `context.go('/focus')`. Task stays `inProgress`; the daily plan shows a "Resume" button.

### Background Notification

When `AppLifecycleState.paused` fires during an active focus session, `NotificationService.showFocusNotification()` shows an `ongoing` Android notification (low importance, no sound). A `Timer.periodic` updates the notification body every minute. Cancelled on `AppLifecycleState.resumed`.

## Auth Provider Interface

The app supports multiple authentication backends selected at compile time.

### AuthProvider abstract interface

`app/lib/auth/auth_provider_interface.dart` defines:
- `buildLoginWidget(context)` — returns the sign-in widget for that backend.
- `signIn(params)` — performs sign-in; returns `AuthResult`.
- `signOut(refreshToken)` — revokes the server session.
- `restore()` — silently restores a session from secure storage; returns `AuthResult?`.

### AuthResult

`AuthResult` is the canonical return type for every provider sign-in:

```dart
class AuthResult {
  final String accessToken;
  final String refreshToken;
  final String userId;  // decoded from the JWT `sub` claim
}
```

`AuthNotifier` in `providers/auth_provider.dart` only deals with `AuthResult` — it never inspects JWT bytes itself.

### Compile-time mode selection

`app/lib/auth/auth_mode.dart` exposes `authImplProvider` (a Riverpod `Provider<AuthProvider>`).  The active implementation is chosen at build time:

```bash
flutter run --dart-define=JEEVES_AUTH_MODE=sws   # Sign-In With Solana
flutter run                                        # default: email + password
```

| `JEEVES_AUTH_MODE` | Implementation | File |
|---|---|---|
| `password` (default) | `PasswordAuthProvider` | `auth/password/password_auth_provider.dart` |
| `sws` | `SwsAuthProvider` | `auth/sws/sws_auth_provider.dart` |

### Adding a new auth provider

1. Create `app/lib/auth/<name>/<name>_auth_provider.dart` implementing `AuthProvider`.
2. Add a case to the `switch` in `auth_mode.dart`.
3. Pass `--dart-define=JEEVES_AUTH_MODE=<name>` at run time.

## Local Search

Universal search is implemented entirely client-side against the local SQLite store, with no network dependency.

### SearchDao

`lib/database/daos/search_dao.dart` — a plain Dart class (not a `@DriftAccessor`) that exposes a single `search(userId, SearchQuery)` method returning a reactive `Stream<List<SearchResult>>`.

**Query strategy:** A single Drift LEFT OUTER JOIN across `todos`, `todo_tags`, and `tags`. Drift's type-safe `readTable` / `readTableOrNull` API handles all column mapping so no manual SQL parsing is needed. Structured filters (state, energy level, time estimate, due date range) are applied as SQL WHERE clauses. Free-text search and tag-scope filtering are applied in Dart after the join, which avoids FTS5 trigger compatibility issues with PowerSync views.

**Why not FTS5?** In production, `todos` is a PowerSync-managed SQLite view. SQLite only supports `INSTEAD OF` triggers on views, not `AFTER INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE`, so the standard FTS5 content-table + trigger pattern cannot be used. LIKE + Dart-side string matching on 10k rows completes in < 10 ms in practice.

### Search models

- `lib/models/search_query.dart` — plain Dart class holding text, state set, tag-ID set, energy levels, date range, time-estimate cap, and the `includeDone` flag. No code generation required.
- `lib/models/search_result.dart` — wraps a Drift `Todo` + its `List<Tag>` + a `Set<SearchMatchField>` indicating which fields matched + an optional notes snippet.

### Providers

`lib/providers/search_provider.dart`:

- `searchQueryProvider` — `NotifierProvider<SearchQueryNotifier, SearchQuery>` that the search screen writes to on each (debounced) keystroke.
- `searchResultsProvider` — `StreamProvider.autoDispose` that watches `searchQueryProvider` and delegates to `SearchDao.search`, grouping results by `GtdState`.
- `recentSearchesProvider` — `NotifierProvider<RecentSearchesNotifier, List<String>>` backed by `SharedPreferences` (max 10 entries, MRU order).

### Navigation

The search screen lives at `/search` outside the `ShellRoute` (full-screen, no drawer). It is reachable via:
- The **Search** entry in the drawer navigation (visible on every GTD list screen).
- **Ctrl+K** or **/** keyboard shortcuts registered in `AppShell` via Flutter's `Shortcuts` + `Actions` API.

## Focus Session Planning State

The focus session planning feature uses a mix of global `ValueNotifier` objects (for cross-widget reactivity without a Riverpod container) and `SharedPreferences` for persistence across restarts.

### Key objects

| Object | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `focusSessionPlanningCompletionNotifier` | `ValueNotifier<bool>` | `true` when the ritual has been completed today |
| `focusSessionPlanningBannerDismissedNotifier` | `ValueNotifier<bool>` | `true` when the banner has been dismissed today |
| `FocusSessionPlanningNotifier` | Riverpod `NotifierProvider` | Step navigation, task mutations, banner dismiss, skip/snooze |
| `FocusSessionPlanningSettingsNotifier` | Riverpod `NotifierProvider` | User preferences: planning time, notification/banner toggles, snooze duration |

Both `ValueNotifier` objects are initialised from `SharedPreferences` in `initFocusSessionPlanningCompletion()`, which is called in `main()` before `runApp`.

### Planning nudges

The ritual can no longer be auto-launched. Users are nudged through two opt-in mechanisms:

1. **`FocusSessionPlanningBanner`** (`lib/widgets/focus_session_planning_banner.dart`) — rendered at the top of `AppShell` (all shell-hosted routes). Visible when `focusSessionPlanningCompletionNotifier == false && !focusSessionPlanningBannerDismissedNotifier && planningSettings.bannerEnabled`. Tapping navigates to `/focus-session-planning`; the × button calls `FocusSessionPlanningNotifier.dismissBannerForToday()`.

2. **Local notification** — scheduled daily at the user's configured planning time via `NotificationService.scheduleFocusSessionPlanningReminder()`. Uses `flutter_local_notifications` `zonedSchedule` with `matchDateTimeComponents: time` so the OS re-fires it every day without app interaction. Notification actions: Open (→ `/focus-session-planning`), Snooze (one-off reschedule), Skip today (cancel until tomorrow). Handled in `_handleNotificationResponse` in `main.dart`. `matchDateTimeComponents: time` means the OS reschedules the notification daily automatically — snooze cancels the repeating schedule and registers a one-off fire instead.

### SharedPreferences keys

| Key | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `planning_ritual_completed_date` | `yyyy-MM-dd` | Date of last completed ritual |
| `planning_banner_dismissed_date` | `yyyy-MM-dd` | Date banner was last dismissed |
| `planning_notification_skipped_date` | `yyyy-MM-dd` | Date user hit "Skip today" |
| `planning_notification_snoozed_until` | ISO-8601 datetime | When the snoozed notification will fire |
| `focus_session_planning_settings_time_hour` | `int` | Planning time hour |
| `focus_session_planning_settings_time_minute` | `int` | Planning time minute |
| `focus_session_planning_settings_notification_enabled` | `bool` | Notification toggle |
| `focus_session_planning_settings_banner_enabled` | `bool` | Banner toggle |
| `focus_session_planning_settings_default_snooze_duration` | `int` (minutes) | Default snooze duration |

## Sprint Timer (Pomodoro Engine)

Focus Mode includes an optional Pomodoro sprint timer bound to the active task. It is not a separate mode — it lives inside the Active Focus Screen as a carousel page revealed by swiping the notes view left. Sprint and break durations are user-configurable (default 20/3 min). The timer persists across app backgrounding via SharedPreferences and fires a local notification at expiry.

### Settings

`lib/models/focus_settings.dart` — `FocusSettings` value type with `sprintDurationMinutes` (default 20) and `breakDurationMinutes` (default 3).

`lib/providers/focus_settings_provider.dart` — `FocusSettingsNotifier` persists values to SharedPreferences under `focus_settings_sprint_duration_minutes` and `focus_settings_break_duration_minutes`. Exposed in Settings → **FOCUS MODE**.

### State machine

`lib/providers/sprint_timer_provider.dart` — `SprintTimerNotifier` (a Riverpod `NotifierProvider<SprintTimerNotifier, SprintTimerState>`).

**Phases:**

| Phase | Duration | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `idle` | — | No sprint running |
| `focus` | configurable (default 20 min) | Active sprint, countdown running |
| `break_` | configurable (default 3 min) | Break between sprints |

**Key operations:**

- `startSprint(Todo)` — reads `focusSettingsProvider` for durations, then starts a focus sprint; triggers haptic feedback and schedules a local notification.
- `pauseSprint()` / `resumeSprint()` — freezes/resumes the remaining duration; cancels/reschedules the end notification.
- `completeSprint()` — logs the sprint duration to `todos.time_spent_minutes`, then starts the break timer.
- `stopSprint()` — cancels the timer and clears all persisted state.
- `skipBreak()` — ends the break early and records `lastBreakEndedAt`.

All mutating methods are guarded by `isProcessing: bool` to prevent rapid-tap race conditions.

### Post-break cooldown

`SprintTimerState.isPostBreakCooldown` returns `true` for `breakDurationMinutes` after a break ends (based on `lastBreakEndedAt`). While active, the Jeeves elapsed-time banner suppresses "perhaps take a break" suggestions.

### Persistence across backgrounding

When a sprint starts the notifier stores the absolute end time in `SharedPreferences`. On app resume, `_restoreFromPrefs()` reads the stored end time and recalculates the remaining duration. If the timer has already expired, the expired handler runs immediately (logs time and starts the break, or resets to idle).

**SharedPreferences keys:**

| Key | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `sprint_active_task_id` | String | ID of the task being sprinted |
| `sprint_active_task_title` | String | Cached task title for restore |
| `sprint_end_time` | ISO-8601 datetime | Absolute end time of the current timer |
| `sprint_phase` | `'focus'` \| `'break'` | Current phase |
| `sprint_sprint_number` | int | 1-indexed sprint number |
| `sprint_total_sprints` | int | Total sprints for the task |
| `sprint_is_paused` | bool | Whether the timer is paused |
| `sprint_remaining_seconds` | int | Seconds remaining when paused |
| `sprint_last_break_ended_at` | ISO-8601 datetime | When the last break ended (for cooldown) |

### Notifications

Two stable notification IDs are reserved in `NotificationService`:

- `_kSprintEndNotificationId = 2` — fires when the focus sprint expires.
- `_kBreakEndNotificationId = 3` — fires when the break expires.

Both use `AndroidScheduleMode.exactAllowWhileIdle` (one-shot, not repeating), with a runtime fallback to `inexact` if `canScheduleExactNotifications()` returns false.

### Sprint count

Sprint count for a task is derived from its `timeEstimate` and the configured `sprintDurationMinutes`:

```text
totalSprints = max(1, ceil(timeEstimate / sprintDurationMinutes))
currentSprint = floor(timeSpentMinutes / sprintDurationMinutes) + 1
```

### Time tracking

When a sprint completes normally (`completeSprint`) or the timer expires while the app is backgrounded, the notifier atomically increments `time_spent_minutes` by the sprint duration in a single SQL UPDATE via Drift's `RawValuesInsertable`. The single-statement approach avoids a read-modify-write race with PowerSync's sync writes. This is best-effort: failures are silently ignored so the UI remains responsive.

### Batching suggestion

`findBatchingCandidates(List<Todo>, {int sprintMinutes = 20})` scans today's tasks for micro-tasks (estimate ≤ 15 min) and greedily selects the largest subset (sorted by estimate ascending) whose combined total fits within one sprint. If 2 or more such tasks are found, Focus Mode shows a dismissible suggestion banner. The caller passes the current `sprintDurationMinutes` from `focusSettingsProvider`.

### UI

- `lib/widgets/sprint_timer_widget.dart` — full carousel page with an idle view ("Start Sprint" button) and an active view (progress ring, MM:SS countdown, phase badge, sprint-dot indicator, playback controls).
- `lib/screens/active_focus_screen.dart` — `PageView` carousel: page 0 = notes (markdown with checkbox support), page 1 = `SprintTimerWidget`. A `_PageDots` indicator sits below the page view. Swipe left from notes to reach the sprint timer.
- `lib/screens/focus_screen.dart` — task list only; no sprint controls. Sprint count badges on task rows use `focusSettingsProvider.sprintDurationMinutes`.

## Navigation & Global Filter State

### Tag Cloud Navigation Filter

A sticky, multi-select context-tag filter lives in the navigation drawer and persists across screen navigation for the duration of the app session.

**State:** `TagFilterNotifier` (a `Notifier<Set<String>>` in `app/lib/providers/tag_filter_provider.dart`) holds the active set of context tag IDs.  Calling `toggle(id)` adds or removes a tag; `clear()` resets the set.  The `tagFilterProvider` is app-scoped so the state survives route changes.

**Drawer widget:** `TagCloud` (`app/lib/screens/common/tag_cloud.dart`) renders a `Wrap` of `FilterChip`s sourced from `contextTagsWithCountProvider`.  Chip visual weight (font size and opacity) scales linearly with each tag's active-task count relative to the maximum in the set.  Tags with zero active tasks are hidden unless currently selected.  Long-pressing a chip opens `TagManagementSheet` for rename/recolour/merge.

**Active filter indicator:** `_ActiveFilterBar` (embedded in `GtdListScreen`) and `_InboxFilterBar` (embedded in `InboxScreen`) show the currently selected tags as removable `InputChip`s plus a "Clear all" button.  The CONTEXTS section header in the drawer gains a count badge when any filter is active.

**DAO layer:** `TagDao.watchTagsWithActiveCount(userId, type)` uses a `customSelect` SQL query with `readsFrom: {tags, todoTags, todos}` so the count stream re-emits reactively when any of the three tables change.  Each GTD watch method in `TodoDao` and `InboxDao` accepts an optional `Set<String> tagIds` parameter; when non-empty a SQL subquery enforces AND semantics: `COUNT(DISTINCT tag_id) WHERE tag_id IN (...) = N`.

**Provider wiring:** Every GTD list provider (`nextActionsProvider`, `waitingForProvider`, `somedayMaybeProvider`, `blockedTasksProvider`, `scheduledProvider`, `inboxItemsProvider`) watches `tagFilterProvider` and passes the current tag set to its DAO method.  When the filter changes, Riverpod automatically cancels and re-subscribes the DAO stream, so the list view re-renders without any additional work in the UI layer.
